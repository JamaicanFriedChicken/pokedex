## ReactJS Pokedex

This is a simple pokedex made using React and utilising the the API endpoints of [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to further my understanding of API services and how it interacts with the web applications. The demo is available [here](https://jamaicanfriedchicken.github.io/pokedex/).

## TODO

- To separate and distinguish each generation of pokemon.
- Create a search bar to search and filter out pokemon.
